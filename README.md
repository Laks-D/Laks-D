# Haii ! I'm  Laksman Dhinahar
**Building systems that scale, with capital I don’t have and secrets I can’t tell.**

---

### This is me :  
I’m a CS student (Class of 2027) based in **Chennai**, currently operating at the intersection of "I have an idea" and "How did he build that with zero budget?" 

My specialty is the **Zero-Capital Startup**: taking raw logic and turning it into commercially viable B2C systems. Whether it's **Java** for the heavy lifting or **Flutter** for the front-row seat, I build for scale, not for show.

### "Quiet" GitHub ??
If my contribution graph looks suspiciously calm, it’s because my code is currently living a double life. 

Most of my work—ranging from **proprietary freelance engines** to **stealth-mode research** in Cryptography—is tucked away under NDAs and private repositories. I spend my time building for businesses that value privacy as much as performance.

**Think of this profile as a speakeasy:** The best stuff is hidden behind the curtain. However, I’m always down to provide a private tour of my core systems—like **ECHO**, **Reserve**, or **Atelier**—upon request.
